OrientAGraph
============

OrientAGraph enables **Maximum Likelihood Network Orientation (MNLO)** to be utilized as a search heuristic within [TreeMix](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002967), a popular package for estimating admixture graphs.
We found that MLNO improved (or else did not impact) the accuracy of the original TreeMix method in an experimental study.

Installation
------------
OrientAGraph has only been tested on Linux using gcc versions 4.8.5 and 4.9.3 and GSL version 2.6.Â 

1. If your system does not have GSL installed, then you will need to install it, for example with the following commands:
```
cd $HOME
mkdir gsl-2.6-local-install
wget https://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/gnu/gsl/gsl-latest.tar.gz
tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz
cd gsl-2.6
./configure --prefix=$HOME/gsl-2.6-local-install
make
make check
make install
```
2. Export the environmental variables:
```
export INCLUDE_PATH="$HOME/gsl-2.6-local-install/include"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/gsl-2.6-local-install/lib"
```
3. Then, download and build OrientAGraph.
```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ekmolloy/OrientAGraph.git
cd OrientAGraph
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I${INCLUDE_PATH} LDFLAGS=-L${LIBRARY_PATH}
make
```
4. Update `~/.base_profile` to contain the following lines:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/gsl-2.6-local-install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/OrientAGraph/src:$PATH"
```
5. If everything has gone well, then typing
```
source ~/.bash_profile
orientagraph
```
should produce the help message:
```
OrientAGraph 1.0

OrientAGraph is built from TreeMix v1.13 Revision 231
by J.K. Pickrell and J.K. Pritchard and has several new
features, including the option to run Maximum Likelihood
Network Orientation (MLNO) as part of the admixture graph
search heuristic.

TreeMix Options:
-h display this help
-i [file name] input file
-o [stem] output stem (will be [stem].treeout.gz, [stem].cov.gz, [stem].modelcov.gz)
-k [int] number of SNPs per block for estimation of covariance matrix (1)
-global Do a round of global rearrangements after adding all populations
-tf [file name] Read the tree topology from a file, rather than estimating it
-m [int] number of migration edges to add (0)
-root [string] comma-delimited list of populations to set on one side of the root (for migration)
-g [vertices file name] [edges file name] read the graph from a previous TreeMix run
-se Calculate standard errors of migration weights (computationally expensive)
-micro microsatellite data
-bootstrap Perform a single bootstrap replicate
-cor_mig [file] list of known migration events to include (also use -climb)
-noss Turn off sample size correction
-seed [int] Set the seed for random number generation
-n_warn [int] Display first N warnings

OrientAGraph Options:
-mlno Run maximum likelihood network orientation subroutine as part of search heuristic
-allmigs Try all legal ways of adding migration edge to base tree instead of using the minimum residual heuristic
-popaddorder [file with list of populations] Specify the order to add populations when building the starting tree
-givenmat [se matrix file] Allows user to input matrix (e.g. [stem].cov) with the -i flag, 
    the matrix after this option should contain the standard error (e.g. [stem].covse); 
    if no matrix is provided after this option, then 0.0001 is used.
-refit Allows user to (re)fit model parameters on starting tree (-tf) or graph (-g)
-score [1, 2, 3, 4] Score input tree (-tf) or graph (-g) without refitting (0), with refitting (1),
    evaluating each base tree and returning the best (2), or
    evaluating each network orientation and returning the best (3)
```
